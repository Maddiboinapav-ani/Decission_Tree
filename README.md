# Decission_Tree
Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks
often visualized as a tree structure where each internal node represents a "test" or "decision" on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that test, and each leaf node represents a class label (in classification) or a continuous value (in regression).
